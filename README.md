This repository contains projects for Udacity Programming For Data Science Using Python Nanodegree.

## Sql Project

### Overview

This project consisted in the exploration of a provided database movie rentals in which i had to write and run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of my queries. 

For the presentation component, i had to create four slides, and each should have (a) a question of interest, (b) a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question, (c) a supporting visualization created using the csv file gotten from the result of the SQL queries that answer the questions of interest, and (d) a small summary on each slide.


### Question Sets

Questions for the project can be found in the slides file

## Python project

### Overview

In this project, i had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. i had to write code to (a) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Project Submission

The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to chose to view raw data.



#### Files Used

The required files for running this program are: 

* washington.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* chicago.csv

#### Requirements
This program was written in Python (version 3.7.1) and relies on the following libraries:

* pandas==0.23.4
* numpy==1.15.4

## Project 3

This project consisted in using Git and GitHub with a simulated workflow to refactor Project 2.

### Project Submission

The Project Submission consisted in the filling of a template with all the Git commands used to perform the requested tasks.
